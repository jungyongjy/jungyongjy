## Hi there 👋

I am Jung Yong, a Business Analytics undergraduate from SUSS. I enjoy turning ideas into insights, and I'm currently working on an end-to-end project on [TBD].
I'm currently learning Predictive Models and SQL, and I'm looking for help with advanced Python for Data Analytics. 

My personal hobbies include reading classic literature, but I also enjoy non-fiction books every now and then to keep things fresh. 

If you want to connect with me: jywong012@suss.edu.sg is where you'll get the fastest response.
